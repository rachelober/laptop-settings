Laptop-Settings
===============

Inspired by the many projects out there that are easy scripts to execute to set up a new development machine.

What this installs
------------------

* My fork of ThoughtBot's Laptop script (30 minutes)
* My fork of Oh-My-Zsh! (few minutes)
* Janus by carlhuda (few minutes)
* My dotfiles (mere seconds)

Installation
------------

Just run this wafer-thin line of code and let it do the rest of the work:

    bash < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/master/ubuntu)

Help Out
--------
